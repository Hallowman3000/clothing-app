# Clothing App

This repository has been refreshed with a modern baseline project setup so future feature work can be added consistently.

## What's Included

- Repository-wide formatting defaults via `.editorconfig`
- Safer Git behavior via `.gitattributes`
- A practical starter `.gitignore`
- Changelog tracking for future releases

## Next Steps

1. Add your application source code (frontend/backend) under agreed directories.
2. Add runtime and test tooling for your chosen stack.
3. Wire CI checks (lint, test, build) once implementation files are present.

## Project Status

Scaffold and standards are in place; application implementation is pending.
